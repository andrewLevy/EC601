Homework 1 Image Processing using openCV lib.

The purpose of the accompanying openCV application is to blur an input image.  The alteration that we made was to increase the blurriness of the output photo.  Our application uses the GaussianBlur function from the openCV libraries to provide a Gaussian filter to the image.  We increased the standard deviation of the Gaussian filter in both the x and y dimensions to increase blurriness.

To run application enter:
./BlurImage apple.png (or name of file storing image)
